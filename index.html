		<div>An Unnerving Situation in Dampgulley Bend
</div>
		<div>by
Jason Pape</div>
		<div>Frogtober 35th, 5327
The sleepy hamlet of Dampgully Bend can be found in the northernmost reaches of the Duchy of Rana, just past Log-End and west of Plembley Trench. It is a peaceful and quiet place, presided over by Archbaroness Marjorie Thimbleblister.

		<div>Frogtober 43rd, 5327
But one evening a portentous fog engulfed the land. The Retinal Moon cast a sinister light over the rolling hills, and the Bridgeless Pylons began to hum and emit beams of green light.

The residents of the land cowered in fear, hiding in the (comfortably wet) fountain on the south hill that overlooked the bend. They spoke among themselves: One suggested enlisting the aid of Duke Phineas the Cowardly, but it was quickly pointed out by another that the good duke had already fled to his vacation home in Clarby Swamp.

Yet it came to pass that the residents of Dampgulley Bend had naught to fear, for their Moonrock Guardian, who had fallen from the sky over a decade ago and landed in the shade beneath the Lantern Tree, offered protection from all ill betidings.
